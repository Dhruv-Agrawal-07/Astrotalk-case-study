🌟 Astrotalk – UX Case Study

Improving astrologer discovery & user trust through better search + personalization

This project focuses on enhancing the user experience of the Astrotalk mobile app — a popular astrology & spiritual consultation platform. Using the CIRCLES product design framework, I analyzed real user challenges and redesigned key flows to help users find the right astrologer faster and more confidently.

✔ Search-to-connection conversion
✔ User trust & decision clarity
✔ Personalization based on user behavior
✔ Engagement and satisfaction
